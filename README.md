[![Deploy to Cloudflare](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9d6358a5-2b85-4974-9adb-bd157c311b1f)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/eastlondoner/mineflare)

Run a full Minecraft Java server on the edge with real-time monitoring, authentication, and plugin management powered by Cloudflare Workers and Containers.

🎮 You get a single Cloudflare `standard-4` container with 4 vCPUs, 12 GiB of memory and 20 GB of storage, enough to comfortably accomodate 20 players.
💵 This costs approximately 50 cents per hour to run on Cloudflare. The server automatically shuts down after 20 minutes of inactivity to save costs, your maps and plugin configurations are saved to R2 storage and restored when you start the server again.

⚠️ I am not responsible for any costs associated with running this server! Leaving a Container running 24/7 can cost you $100s per month 💸

## 🚀 Quick Start

Click on the Deploy to Cloudflare button above to deploy to Cloudflare.
The Cloudflare free tier is not supported for Containers so you have an account on the $5/month Cloudflare paid plan (or higher) to deploy.

### First-Time Setup

1. Navigate to your deployed worker URL
2. Click "Set Password" to secure your Server with a password
3. Login with your credentials
4. Click "Start Server" to launch the Minecraft container
5. While you're waiting for the server to start up head over to https://playit.gg/ and sign up for a free account. DO NOT create an agent or a tunnel in playit.gg, this will be done automatically for you in step 6.
6. Wait 2-3 minutes for the server to fully initialize
7. Follow the playit.gg server address shown in the plugin panel to connect to your server via playit.gg
8. Use your playit.gg server address `<some-name>.gl.joinmc.link` to connect to your Cloudflare Minecraft server

## 🎮 Minecraft Version Support

Mineflare supports multiple Paper Minecraft versions in a single deployment:

- **1.21.7** (Legacy) - Older stable release for maximum compatibility
- **1.21.8** (Stable) - Recommended for most users, default version
- **1.21.10** (Experimental) - Latest features, may have stability issues

**Switching Versions:**
1. Stop your server using the "Stop Server" button
2. Select your desired version in the "Minecraft Version" panel
3. Click to switch (takes a few seconds)
4. Start your server - it will boot with the new version

⚠️ **Important:** Always backup your world before switching versions. Downgrading versions may not be fully supported and could cause world compatibility issues.

## ✨ Features

## 🏗️ Architecture

**Core Components:**
- **Main Worker** (`src/worker.ts`) - Elysia API server
- **Frontend** - Preact SPA with Eden Treaty client using polling for real-time updates
- **MinecraftContainer** (`src/container.ts`) - Durable Object managing server lifecycle & security
- **HTTP Proxy** - Custom TCP-to-HTTP bridge in Bun binary allows container to securely connect to R2 via bindings (no R2 tokens needed)
- **Dynmap Worker** - Separate worker serving Mini-Map

## Alternative Networking Options

If you do not want to use playit.gg, you can use Tailscale or Cloudflare Tunnels for super secure private networking but it's harder to share with friends.

### Using Tailscale for super secure private networking

These instructions are only if you do not want to use playit.gg and want to use Tailscale for private networking instead.

1. Disable the playit.gg plugin in the plugin panel
2. Generate a Tailscale authentication key in your Tailscale account settings
3. Create a TS_AUTHKEY *build* secret in your mineflare worker on Cloudflare and re-deploy your worker
4. Look in your tailscale dashboard for a new node called "cloudchamber", grab the private IP address
5. Create a new server in Minecraft using the address `<tailscale private ip>` and connect to your Cloudflare Minecraft server

### Using Cloudflare Tunnels for super secure private networking

Instructions coming soon....


## Local Development

### Prerequisites for local development

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) javascript runtime
- Cloudflare account with Workers and R2 enabled

### Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Start local development environment
bun run dev
```

### Deployment from local checkout

```bash
# Configure alchemy
bun run configure

# Login to Alchemy
bun run login

# Deploy to Cloudflare
bun run deploy
```

After deployment, you'll receive URLs for:
- Main worker (API and frontend)
- Dynmap worker (map tiles)

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

Required environment variables (set in `.env` file):

```env
# Cloudflare credentials (from Alchemy login)
CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=your_account_id
CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=your_api_token

# Optional: Tailscale for private networking
TS_AUTHKEY=your_tailscale_key

# Optional: Alchemy password for state encryption
ALCHEMY_PASSWORD=your_secure_password
```

### Container Settings

Configure via the web UI:
- **Minecraft Version** - Switch between 1.21.7 (Legacy), 1.21.8 (Stable), 1.21.10 (Experimental)
- **Plugin Management** - Enable/disable optional plugins when server is stopped

Advanced settings in `src/container.ts`:
- `sleepAfter` - Auto-sleep timeout (default: 20 minutes)
- `INIT_MEMORY` / `MAX_MEMORY` - Server memory allocation (default: 5G/11G)
- Plugin environment variable configurations

## 🔌 Plugin System

Mineflare supports optional Minecraft plugins that can be enabled/disabled via the web UI:

**Built-in Plugins:**
- **Dynmap** - Always enabled, provides live web-based map
- **playit.gg** - Optional tunnel service for external access

**Adding Custom Plugins:**

Instructions coming soon....

## 🛠️ Development Commands

```bash
# Build worker code
bun run build

# Build container services including HTTP proxy binary and File server binary
./docker_src/build-container-services.sh

# Build single multi-version container image with all Paper versions
# Includes 1.21.7, 1.21.8, and 1.21.10 in one image
# Builds for both amd64 and arm64 architectures
bun ./docker_src/build.ts

# Destroy deployed resources
bun run destroy

# Show Alchemy version
bun run version
```

### Container Build Process

The container build system (`docker_src/build.ts`) creates a single multi-version image:

- Builds one container image containing all three Paper versions (1.21.7, 1.21.8, 1.21.10)
- Multi-platform support (linux/amd64, linux/arm64)
- Includes version-specific Dynmap plugins for all Paper versions
- Uses Docker buildx with registry caching for fast rebuilds
- Caches build state to skip unnecessary rebuilds
- The `VERSION` environment variable selects which Paper version runs at container startup
- Image tag is written to `.BASE_DOCKERFILE` for Alchemy

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- Container costs can be significant including CPU, memory, storage and network egress costs. These will apply based on usage (check Cloudflare pricing, leaving a cloudflare container running 24/7 can cost you $100s per month)
- R2 storage has minimal costs (generous free tier)
- Workers have generous free tier (100k requests/day)
